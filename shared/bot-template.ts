/**
 * The Bot template format: one file describing one coworker.
 *
 * Configuration travels; capability does not. A template carries a coworker's identity and its
 * prose, the skills it depends on, the capabilities it *asks* for, and a ceiling on what it may do.
 * It carries no id, no endpoint URL, no credential, no MCP grant, no component source and no policy
 * rule, because none of those are fields here — a document containing one fails to parse rather than
 * being quietly stripped, so an author who tried to ship a key is told, and a reviewer reading the
 * file is not reading a redacted copy of something larger.
 *
 * The vocabulary is deliberately the tenant package's (`role_description`, `avatar_seed`, and a
 * skill's `slug`/`title`/`summary`/`instructions`/`tools`), so anybody who has read
 * `examples/fintech/` can read a template. It diverges on three points, and each is a security
 * decision rather than a preference:
 *
 *   1. STRICT PARSING. `validateTenantPackage` reads the keys it knows and ignores the rest, which is
 *      right for an operator's own directory: a stale key from an older product version should not
 *      stop a deployment booting. It is wrong for a stranger's file, where an ignored key is a key
 *      the reviewer's eye slid over and the parser agreed to. Here an unrecognised key anywhere is a
 *      refusal naming it.
 *
 *   2. NO ENVIRONMENT INTERPOLATION, AT ALL. `expandEnvironment` substitutes textually, before the
 *      YAML is parsed, out of the server's own environment. In a package that is how one file serves
 *      a laptop, a staging stack and production. In a stranger's file it is an exfiltration
 *      primitive: a `role_description` naming the deployment's key-encryption key or computer token
 *      would be expanded, stored, shown to a model and readable afterwards. There is no allowlist of
 *      variable names and no escaping — the opening sequence is refused wherever it appears, and it
 *      is checked against the raw bytes rather than the parsed document, so a comment cannot carry
 *      it either.
 *
 *   3. THE API'S SLUG RULE, not the package's. The package's admits `x` and `find-`, both of which
 *      install cleanly and are then permanently uneditable through the product, because the Skills
 *      API refuses to save what the package was allowed to create.
 *
 * Nothing in this file reads the database, the environment or the network. It is the whole of what a
 * template *is*, so the refusals can be tested as pure functions and the same parse runs at preview
 * and again at install.
 */
