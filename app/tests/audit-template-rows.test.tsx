/**
 * How the template family reads on the audit page.
 *
 * The bug this pins: nine event types were added to the closed list in `server/src/audit.ts` and
 * this screen, which has to agree about that list, was not told. Every one of them fell through to
 * the fallback that calls an unrecognised type "Allowed" — so `template.import_refused`, the row an
 * investigator opens this page to find, said the deployment had allowed the document it turned
 * away, in the muted foreground rather than the refusal colour. That is the one wrong answer, and a
 * trail that is confidently wrong is worse than a silent one.
 *
 * Rendered rather than unit-tested against a lookup table, because the fallback is the thing under
 * test: a table that knows nothing still prints a word, and only the rendered cell shows which.
 *
 * NO MODULE MOCKS. `mock.module` in bun is process-wide and does not come back, so mocking
 * `@/lib/client` here would change what every other file in the suite imports. The transport is
 * stubbed at `fetch` and restored afterwards.
 */
/*
 * Registered only when nothing else has already done it.
 *
 * `register()` throws outright when a DOM is installed, and bun runs the app tests in one process,
 * so whichever browser-side file loads second used to take the whole suite down with "Happy DOM has
 * already been globally registered" — a failure that says nothing about the code under test and
 * moves depending on which file the runner happened to reach first.
 */
/*
 * Registered with an address, and only if nothing else has registered already.
 *
 * Happy DOM defaults to `about:blank`, whose origin is the STRING "null". Better Auth builds its
 * base URL from `window.location.origin` when it is not given one, so the first file in the suite to
 * pull in `@/lib/auth/client` under a bare registration throws `Invalid base URL: null` while it is
 * still being imported — taking that file's tests with it and reporting an unhandled error rather
 * than a failure anybody can place.
 *
 * It stayed hidden locally because `auth-client.test.ts` stubs a window with a real origin and, when
 * it happens to run first, the auth client is already constructed and cached by the time anything
 * here renders. That is an ordering accident, not a guarantee: on CI the order differs and this is
 * where it landed. An explicit address makes the origin real however the suite is walked.
