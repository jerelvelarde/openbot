 * The consent screen, rendered.
 *
 * The section order is the property worth pinning: the whole argument of this screen is that a
 * stranger's prose comes before the capability list and the button, and an ordering is exactly the
 * kind of thing a later refactor moves without anybody noticing. So is the pair of rules underneath
 * it — that the prose is text rather than markup, and that an address the author typed is never an
 * anchor.
 *
 * The second thing pinned here is harder to see: the CLASS NAMES on the strings a model is given.
 * CSS does not run in this DOM, so `truncate` and a missing `break-words` are invisible to
 * `textContent` — a test can assert a hostile title is in the document while the browser shows the
 * reviewer half of it. Those assertions therefore read the class attribute directly, which is ugly
 * and is the only way to catch the thing that actually went wrong.
 *
 * NO MODULE MOCKS. `mock.module` in bun is process-wide and does not come back, so a file that
 * mocked `@/lib/client` or the router here would silently change what every other test file in the
 * suite imports — which is not hypothetical: doing it broke `plugin-grants.test.ts` and would have
 * broken `router.test.ts` on a different walk order. The transport is stubbed at `fetch`, which is
 * restored afterwards, and the router is a real one over a memory history.
 */
/*
 * Guarded, because `register` throws outright on a second call and bun walks every test file into
 * one process. Whichever DOM test file the walk reaches first installs the window; the rest find it
 * already there. Registering unconditionally made the second such file throw during import, which
 * takes its whole suite with it and reports nothing.
 */
/*
 * Registered with an address, and only if nothing else has registered already.
 *
 * Happy DOM defaults to `about:blank`, whose origin is the STRING "null". Better Auth builds its
 * base URL from `window.location.origin` when it is not given one, so the first file in the suite to
 * pull in `@/lib/auth/client` under a bare registration throws `Invalid base URL: null` while it is
 * still being imported — taking that file's tests with it and reporting an unhandled error rather
 * than a failure anybody can place.
 *
 * It stayed hidden locally because `auth-client.test.ts` stubs a window with a real origin and, when
 * it happens to run first, the auth client is already constructed and cached by the time anything
 * here renders. That is an ordering accident, not a guarantee: on CI the order differs and this is
 * where it landed. An explicit address makes the origin real however the suite is walked.
