/**
 * One template, read rather than decided.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE CONSENT SCREEN. Until now the only way to read what a template
 * would tell a model was to open the import flow, which put "let me see what this is" and "I am
 * installing this" behind the same button. That is the wrong shape for the one screen in the product
 * whose content was written by somebody else: a person should be able to study a stranger's
 * instructions at length, close the page, and have changed nothing.
 *
 * So the two surfaces answer two different questions, and neither answers the other's. THIS page
 * shows the template AS WRITTEN — the prose, the skills, the asks with the author's reasons, the
 * ceiling, and the file itself. It resolves nothing against this deployment and it has no state. The
 * CONSENT SCREEN shows what would happen HERE — which connector exists, which slug is taken, whether
 * an address is needed — and carries the only button that writes anything.
 *
 * The prose is rendered through the same components the consent screen uses, deliberately. Verbatim,
 * unabridged and unformatted is a security property rather than a style, and a second implementation
 * of it is a second place for one of those three to be quietly lost.

 * its slug can be rendered on its own, which is what lets a test assert the properties on this page
 * that are security properties rather than styling — that the prose is unabridged, and that no
