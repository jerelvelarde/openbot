 * It has no session by design — whose connection this is comes from the state, not from whatever
 * cookie the browser happens to be carrying. That is what makes the state the only thing standing
 * between a consent screen and a live refresh token in this deployment's vault, and it is why what
 * the state says has to be checked against the deployment as it is when the callback LANDS rather
 * than as it was when the flow started ten minutes earlier.
 *
 * So these tests are mostly about what must not be written: a grant for a state this deployment did
 * not seal, for a state old enough to have expired, or for somebody who no longer has access.
