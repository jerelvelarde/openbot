/**
 * A write inside a caller's transaction must not need a second pooled connection.
 *
 * The template import opens one transaction and installs a Bot, its skills and their grants inside
 * it. Each of those writes also records a trail row, and while that row went to the audit store's
 * own pooled handle the import was holding one connection and asking for another. Bun's `SQL` has
 * no acquisition timeout, so with every connection inside such a transaction the ask never returns:
 * the transactions never commit, never roll back, and never give their connections back, and the
 * deployment stays wedged until it is restarted. Ten concurrent imports were enough.
 *
 * Pinning the pool to one connection is how that becomes a single deterministic test rather than a
 * load-dependent hang, which is what `TEST_POOL` says it is for.
