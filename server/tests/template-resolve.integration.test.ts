/**
 * The preview, which writes nothing and is the only thing standing between a stranger's file and a
 * person's judgement about it.
 *
 * Two properties are asserted hardest. The first is that `available` is a statement about the
 * DEPLOYMENT and never about the Bot — it says a connector is here, not that anything was granted,
 * and the install path turns it into a ledger row that still says `requested`. The second is that a
 * colliding skill slug is never resolved to an overwrite: `installSkill` upserts on `skills.slug`,
 * so "reuse when identical, else suffix, else skip" is the difference between an import and a way to
 * take somebody's `/` command.
