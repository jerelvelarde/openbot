 * is still rendered as a request, there is still no checkbox, and satisfying it is still a separate
 * act on a screen that already refuses. The verdict exists so the screen can say "Drive is connected
 * here, an administrator can grant this in one click" rather than making the importer discover that
 * for themselves.
 *
 * The install path re-runs this on its own transaction rather than trusting the plan it was handed.
 * A preview is a screen a person read; it is not evidence about the database a second later.
