/**
 * The two places a deployment finds templates nobody here wrote: the directory shipped in the image,
 * and a git repository an administrator pinned.
 *
 * NOTHING IS FETCHED FROM THE NETWORK UNLESS AN ADMINISTRATOR HAS REGISTERED A SOURCE, and that is
 * the property this file exists to keep rather than a preference. A self-hosted product that reaches
 * a third party on first boot because the vendor shipped a default has made that decision for its
 * operator. `OPENBOT_TEMPLATE_SOURCES` ships empty, the registry starts empty, and a deployment with
 * no network at all still opens the gallery and finds the in-box directory in it.
 *
 * PER-FILE ISOLATION, WHICH IS THE ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE FROM THE PACKAGE LOADER. A malformed
 * `agents.yaml` kills the process before it serves, because `loadTenantPackage` runs in an unguarded
 * top-level await in `index.ts`, and that is right: a tenant package is an operator's own
 * configuration and a deployment running half of it is worse than one that did not come up. A
 * directory of many authors' files is the opposite case. One person's typo must not stop somebody
 * else's deployment booting, so every file is parsed on its own and a failure is logged with the
 * filename and the reason and skipped. This is the same judgement `synchronizeTenantPackage` already
 * makes for a colliding skill slug: name what was passed over, keep going.
 *
 * A SKIP IS DATA, not only a log line. Every listing carries the files it could not read alongside
 * the ones it could, so an administrator looking at the gallery can be shown "three templates, one
 * skipped" rather than being left to infer an absence. A file that silently vanishes from a
 * catalogue reads as a file that was never there.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO. It never installs anything and never writes a grant. The one thing it
 * does write is `template_sources`, which is the administrator's list of pinned repositories and
 * nothing else — no document, no capability, nothing an install reads. That row exists because a
 * registration held only in memory disappeared at the next restart with nothing saying so; see the
 * comment on `registry` below. What this file hands onwards is a parsed document and its digest, to
 * the resolver and the installer, and that is the same document a paste would have produced — a
 * gallery entry is a stranger's file that happened to arrive by a different road, and it goes
 * through every refusal that road already has.
