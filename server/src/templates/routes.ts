/**
 * The HTTP surface for templates: authoring a draft, reading a stranger's file, and installing it.
 *
 * THIS FILE DECIDES ALMOST NOTHING. The parser refuses a document, the packer refuses a coworker it
 * cannot express, the resolver reports what this deployment can satisfy and the installer writes the
 * one transaction. What is left here is the part that is genuinely the API's: who may ask, what an
 * error becomes on the wire, and which refusals reach the trail. Everything else is delegated, and
 * deliberately so — a route that re-implemented one of those rules would be a second copy of it that
 * drifts.
 *
 * ONE RULE THIS FILE DOES OWN, and it is the whole feature's: satisfying a capability goes through
 * the grant stores that already refuse. The grant route below acts on the LEDGER and hands the
 * decision to `pluginStore.grant` or `componentStore.grant`; it never re-reads the document, so the
 * artifact a person consented to cannot change what is being approved a week later, and there is no
 * second grant path with a second set of checks.
 *
 * WHICH MEANS THIS FILE HOLDS THE ONLY `grant("mcp", …)` UNDER `server/src/templates/`, and anybody
 * writing the grep test that guards the import path has to know that. The property is about the
 * IMPORT: `install.ts` has no code path that writes an MCP grant, not a conditional one and not one
 * behind a flag, because `store.grant` performs no existence check and an optimistic row for an
 * absent connector would be invisible on every screen and would go live the day somebody added that
 * connector, with nobody deciding. The call in `decide` below is the opposite of that in every
 * respect: it is behind `requireAdmin`, it acts on a ledger row a person already consented to, it
 * names a tool this file has just read out of `mcp_servers` and `mcp_tools`, and it is exactly the
 * act the grant screen performs. Scope the grep to the import path rather than to the directory, or
 * it will forbid the thing the feature is for.
 *
 * "IT NAMES A TOOL THAT EXISTS" USED TO BE A CLAIM RATHER THAN A CHECK, and that is the bug this
 * file was carrying. The only guard was that the ref contained a slash, so a ledger row recorded
 * `unavailable` — the row whose consent screen said "Nothing will be granted and nothing will be
 * written" and whose caption on the Bot's profile says there is nothing yet to grant — was one
 * administrator click away from a live `plugin_grants` row for a connector this deployment does not
 * have. Two guards now stand where the claim did, and both are needed: the ledger's own status,
 * because a person was told that ask was inert and connecting a server with that id afterwards is
 * not their consent; and a fresh read of the two tables, because the status is a snapshot from
 * resolve time and a connector can leave the deployment the day after an import.
