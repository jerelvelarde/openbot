   * product of the last refusal's re-registration, and is left exactly alone.

     * does not know what that server offers.

     * a user row being deleted, so by the time somebody is gone the join row can be gone too and the

     * code path. `credentials.key_id` holds the user id for an `mcp_user_token`, so the vault can
     * still be asked directly — which makes this work for the person who was removed and for the one
     * whose row was deleted underneath it.
     *
     * The join rows go too, so the account pages stop claiming a connection this deployment can no
     * longer use.
     *
     * NOT vendor-side revocation. That needs the OAuth client and the vendor's revoke endpoint, and
     * it belongs with disconnect. This is the half that stops us holding the secret; the grant at
